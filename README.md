# Worlde
Welcome to my version of Wordle, the famous word-guessing game from the NY Times! My version has been written entirely in C++, using `Windows.h` and my own graphical library for handling user input and displaying pixels on the screen. What makes this game special from the previous ones, is that it's the first one to use transparent sprites, by adding support for 32-bit BMPs. This allows me to easily change a sprite's background or to use spires with a shadow! I've also improved my use of pop-ups, compared to Minesweeper. Instead of just notifying the user of something important, they now give the user the option to start a new game when they win or lose.

## What I've learned from this project:
- String manipulation in C++
- How to use message boxes in `Windows.h`
- Parsing of more complex files (32-bit BMPs)
- How to display transparent images

### After entering "crane" the 'e' becomes yellow, signalling that it's in the word, but not at the 3rd spot

### Using "Split", the game shows me that the 's' is in the right place

### After some trial and error, I find the right word, and I'm asked if I'd like to start another game

I own none of the rights to Wordle, I just made this to improve at programming :)
